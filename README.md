The project, titled "Blockchain-Based E-Commerce Online Application," is developed to enhance the security, transparency, and trustworthiness of online shopping. E-commerce platforms face various challenges, including data breaches, fraudulent transactions, and centralized control over user data and payment systems.
Traditional e-commerce systems attempt to address these issues but often fall short in providing a fully secure and transparent environment. This blockchain-based application aims to bridge that gap by utilizing decentralized technology and smart contracts to offer a secure and tamper-proof shopping experience. The system improves transaction reliability and customer trust by storing data on a distributed ledger, eliminating the need for intermediaries, and ensuring transparent product tracking and payment verification.
